# Introduction

Since [Next.js 10](https://nextjs.org/blog/next-10), **Automatic Image Optimization** has been introduced which is great for optimizing images on the fly, but it's an exclusive feature for Next.js.

**Urami** is an implementation of the same concept but it's a **universal** solution that works with any JavaScript web framework. There's 2 parts to it:

1. Add **Urami core** to your server endpoint.
2. Add **Urami components** to render optimized images on the client. You can build your own components or use the ones provided by us, or the community.

There's a guide for following examples, but you can also jump to the [Core Overview](/core/overview) if you want to implement server endpoint into other JS frameworks, and [Component Overview](/components/overview) if you want to use optimize image on client-side.
